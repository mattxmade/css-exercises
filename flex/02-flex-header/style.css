/* Self Check

There is space between all items and the edge of the header (specific px amount doesn't matter here).                                   [ CHECK ]

Logo is centered vertically and horizontally.                                                                                           [ CHECK ]

list-items are horizontal, and are centered vertically inside the header.                                                               [ CHECK ]

left-links and right-links are pushed all the way to the left and right, and stay at the edge of the header when the page is resized.   [ CHECK ]

Your solution does not use floats, inline-block, or absolute positioning.                                                               [ CHECK ]
